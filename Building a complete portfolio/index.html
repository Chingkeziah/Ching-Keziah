                    <h1>A Basic Calculator</h1>
                    <p>A BAsic Calculator which I built during my earlier days of learning JavaScriptin in order to 
                        test my skills and to practice what I learnt. I was able to complete this project 
                        by using HTML to set up the skeleton, CSS for the beauty and responsiveness of the design
                        and lastly JavaScript for its functionality.
